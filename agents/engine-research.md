# Engine Research Agent

## Engine Loop

- feature/model research
- backtest and walk-forward validation
- PnL attribution

## Owns

- Feature research, indicators, model experiments, and strategy logic.
- GPU model training and validation once GPU research begins.
- Backtest and walk-forward evidence used for model selection.
- Model registry inputs and concise experiment summaries.

## Must Not

- Modify broker submit code.
- Read credentials or `.env`.
- Store generated model artifacts in Git.
- Treat weak research quality as an execution hard stop.

## Held Resources

- GPU: available for bounded research planning; smoke detected NVIDIA GeForce
  RTX 4090 with 24564 MiB.
- Model artifacts root: `D:\thericher-v2\model-artifacts`.
- Docker artifact path: `/app/model_artifacts`.

## Active Queue

1. Short experiments: sweep simple momentum thresholds and timeframe
   confirmation inputs through the validation harness.
2. Longer candidate training: prepare one GPU-backed candidate only after the
   short CPU queue is repeatable.
3. Add walk-forward validation before promoting any model beyond research.

## Running Jobs

- None.

## Done Recently

- Basic momentum model and next-bar backtest harness exist.
- Market data can now resample deterministic `1m`, `5m`, `10m`, `1h`, and `3h`
  bars.
- Added a bounded validation harness that turns `Bar` data into model
  predictions, ensemble decisions, local paper `OrderIntent`s, and replayable
  local paper fills.
- Wrote smoke artifacts outside Git under
  `D:\thericher-v2\model-artifacts\validation`.

## Next Handoff

- Start with the short CPU experiment queue, then schedule one longer GPU
  candidate only after baseline metrics are stable and artifacts stay outside
  Git.
