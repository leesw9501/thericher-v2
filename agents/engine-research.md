# Engine Research Agent

## Engine Loop

- feature/model research
- backtest and walk-forward validation
- PnL attribution

## Owns

- Feature research, indicators, model experiments, and strategy logic.
- GPU model training and validation once GPU research begins.
- Backtest and walk-forward evidence used for model selection.
- Model registry inputs and concise experiment summaries.

## Must Not

- Modify broker submit code.
- Read credentials or `.env`.
- Store generated model artifacts in Git.
- Treat weak research quality as an execution hard stop.

## Held Resources

- GPU: available for bounded research planning; smoke detected NVIDIA GeForce
  RTX 4090 with 24564 MiB.
- Model artifacts root: `D:\thericher-v2\model-artifacts`.
- Docker artifact path: `/app/model_artifacts`.

## Active Queue

1. Add the first lightweight GPU research job runner so bounded short and
   longer candidate jobs can be queued without growing report/gate sprawl.
2. Keep short walk-forward experiments available for breadth while a longer
   candidate runs.
3. Start longer candidate training only after the job runner writes artifacts
   outside Git and remains replayable.

## Running Jobs

- None.

## Done Recently

- Basic momentum model and next-bar backtest harness exist.
- Market data can now resample deterministic `1m`, `5m`, `10m`, `1h`, and `3h`
  bars.
- Added a bounded validation harness that turns `Bar` data into model
  predictions, ensemble decisions, local paper `OrderIntent`s, and replayable
  local paper fills.
- Wrote smoke artifacts outside Git under
  `D:\thericher-v2\model-artifacts\validation`.
- Added a bounded short experiment queue and wrote metrics artifacts outside Git
  under `D:\thericher-v2\model-artifacts\experiments`.
- Prepared a GPU candidate smoke artifact after the CPU queue completed; no GPU
  training is running.
- Added capped walk-forward windows and PnL attribution metrics; wrote sample
  and FCX walk-forward artifacts outside Git.
- Selected `m1_lb3_b10_s10` as the first walk-forward GPU candidate and wrote a
  `prepared_not_trained` metadata artifact outside Git.
- Added a GPU runtime smoke artifact showing RTX 4090 readiness without adding
  heavy GPU dependencies to the base engine.
- Added a Docker research GPU compute smoke. The research container sees the RTX
  4090, but no compute backend is installed yet, so the artifact is
  `prepared_not_trained` rather than a training result.
- Added a GPU training smoke scaffold with an injected trainer test seam. Host
  execution sees the RTX 4090 but records `prepared_not_trained` until a
  research-only backend is approved and installed.
- Installed PyTorch CUDA only in Docker `research` and ran the tiny training
  smoke on the RTX 4090 for candidate `m1_lb3_b10_s10`; artifact status is
  `training_ran_only`.

## Next Handoff

- The files under `agents/` are stateboards, not autonomous workers. Next work
  should add a minimal research job runner before claiming the Engine Research
  Agent can keep the GPU busy by itself.
