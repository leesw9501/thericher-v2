# Next Codex Goal

Read `HANDOFF.md` first, then continue TheRicher v2 from
`C:\Users\Public\Documents\thericher-v2`.

## Objective

Attach warning-only market-data quality summaries to existing research artifacts.

This advances data collection, feature/model research, and backtest/walk-forward
validation by making local Yahoo slice quality visible in the artifacts that
drive GPU experiments, without creating gates or new job families.

## Hard Boundaries

- Do not call KIS APIs.
- Do not place paper or live orders through any broker.
- Do not read credentials, `.env`, or secret-like files.
- Do not expose a public dashboard.
- Do not import v1 modules wholesale.
- Do not create report/gate sprawl.
- Do not download market data into the Git workspace.
- Do not store generated GPU/model artifacts in the repo. Use
  `D:\thericher-v2\model-artifacts` or the configured artifact root.
- Keep simulated fills labeled with `source: local_paper`.
- Keep disabled broker outcomes labeled separately from local paper, for
  example `source: broker_disabled`.
- Keep PyTorch CUDA confined to the Docker `research` target/profile.
- Do not add PyTorch or other heavy ML dependencies to `pyproject.toml`, the
  base engine image, runtime image, or local dev/test path.
- Do not start a broad scheduler, agent framework, promotion gate, or dashboard
  expansion.
- Do not call any threshold, candidate, or model best, recommended, passed,
  promoted, or production ready.

## Required First Reads

1. Run:

   ```powershell
   .\scripts\start_next_codex_task.ps1
   ```

2. Then read:
   - `HANDOFF.md`
   - `VISION.md`
   - `ARCHITECTURE.md`
   - `AGENTS.md`
   - `DECISIONS.md`
   - `RUNBOOK.md`
   - `agents/README.md`
   - `agents/data.md`
   - `agents/engine-research.md`
   - `agents/execution.md`
   - `agents/infra.md`
   - `agents/review.md`

3. Ask Claude CLI for a short drift-check before architecture-changing edits.

## Required Work

1. Treat `agents/*.md` as lane stateboards, not autonomous workers. Update them
   only where they clarify the active engine loop.
2. Reuse `assess_bar_quality`; do not create another data-quality checker.
3. Attach compact quality summaries to existing candidate training/evaluation
   source-slice or data-source metadata where local Yahoo bars are loaded.
4. Keep summaries descriptive and non-blocking. Do not change dataset rows,
   resampling behavior, local-paper replay, broker boundaries, or model
   thresholds.
5. Add focused tests proving summaries are written for local Yahoo slices,
   omitted or clean for deterministic samples where appropriate, and remain
   credential/network-free.
6. Run one small existing Docker `research` smoke only if needed to prove the
   artifact summary appears outside Git.
7. Refresh `NEXT_CODEX_GOAL.md` again before ending the task.

## Data Policy

- Prefer existing `D:\market_data` snapshots before acquiring anything new.
- Acquire additional data only when it is no-auth, lawful,
  license-compatible, and useful for the active validation loop.
- Stop acquisition for a source when it requires credentials/payment/manual
  access, licensing is unclear, two automated attempts fail, or more data no
  longer improves the active goal.
- If operator help is needed, record exact symbols, markets, date ranges,
  formats, and blocker reasons in `agents/data.md` and the completion report.

## Verification

Run:

```powershell
uv run --extra dev pytest -q
uv run --extra dev ruff check .
docker compose config --quiet
```

Report any focused data-quality artifact smoke command used.

## Suggested Commit Message

`Attach data quality summaries to research artifacts`

## Completion Report

Report:

- files changed,
- tests run,
- commit hash,
- data found or acquired under `D:\market_data`,
- data still needed from the operator, if any,
- whether GPU was used and where artifacts were written,
- what was intentionally not built,
- next recommended goal.
