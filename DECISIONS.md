# Decisions

This is append-only. New decisions go at the bottom.

## 2026-07-14 - Start v2 as a new private repository

Decision: create `thericher-v2` as a new private GitHub repository.

Reason: v1 is valuable as a reference, but its report, gate, and operator
scaffolding now slows engine progress. v2 starts clean and imports only minimal
proven assets.

## 2026-07-14 - Engine-first scope

Decision: v2 focuses on data, features, models, ensemble, backtest, execution,
state, dashboard, and daily review.

Reason: the product exists to find and operate profitable strategies, not to
generate readiness evidence.

## 2026-07-14 - First paper target

Decision: start paper trading with US equities through KIS. Research Korean
equities in parallel, but do not make Korean live or paper execution the first
critical path.

Reason: US paper first reduces surface area while the engine and KIS execution
loop are being rebuilt.

## 2026-07-14 - Timeframe combination policy

Decision: default to hierarchical timeframe combination.

- 1h and 3h define regime and direction.
- 10m confirms trend stability.
- 1m and 5m drive entry and exit timing.

Research may test weighted ensembles, but production promotion requires
out-of-sample evidence and interpretability.

Reason: free-form multi-timeframe blending is easy to overfit.

## 2026-07-14 - GPU research lane

Decision: include a GPU research container early, but keep the real-time trading
loop independent from GPU runtime dependencies.

Reason: deep-learning research is part of the goal, but execution must stay
reproducible and robust.

## 2026-07-14 - Dashboard exposure

Decision: start with authenticated local or LAN dashboard access. Do not expose
the dashboard directly to the public internet.

Reason: the dashboard includes emergency controls. Remote access can later use a
VPN or tunnel if needed.

## 2026-07-14 - Live capital planning

Decision: use KRW 5,000,000 as the initial live planning cap, with a staged ramp
that starts smaller.

Reason: paper performance does not fully model live slippage, spread, latency,
or operational behavior.

## 2026-07-14 - Emergency controls

Decision: dashboard write actions are limited to two independent controls:

- stop new orders,
- cancel open orders.

Reason: the operator needs emergency control without turning the dashboard into
a trading command center.
